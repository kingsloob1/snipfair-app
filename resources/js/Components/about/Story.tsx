                    Founded in 2025, Snipfair was born from a simple
                    observation: finding quality beauty services shouldn't be
                    complicated, expensive, or unreliable. Our founders, having
                    experienced countless frustrations with traditional booking
                    systems and inconsistent service quality, decided to create
                    a better solution. What started as a small platform
                    connecting a handful of stylists with local customers has
                    grown into a comprehensive beauty ecosystem serving
                    thousands of customers across multiple cities. We've
                    maintained our core mission: making beauty services
                    accessible, affordable, and excellent for everyone. Today,
                    Snipfair is proud to be the trusted bridge between talented
                    beauty professionals and customers seeking quality services.
                    We're not just a booking platform â€“ we're a community that
                    celebrates beauty, creativity, and professional excellence.
